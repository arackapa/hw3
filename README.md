### Programming Problem Notes 

For each programming problem, please use the Makefiles in their respective directories.

To test the linked lists, look at llrec-test.cpp and uncomment code to test each function desired. 

To test the stack, please compile using a .cpp test file as the implementation is in the .h file. I have a stack_test.cpp file which can be compiled to test the stack funcitonality. 

To look at the pdf answers for part 4, look at the p4_heaps.pdf file. 

To test the heap, change into the heap_test directory within hw3 directory and run "make test" or "make valgrind" -- all tests will pass. 

To look at the logicsim -- look at the my_or.png, my_and.png, my_exclusive_or.png, and my_not.png files 

Everything in here should be working to my knowledge and testing. Thank you for looking at my assignment!
